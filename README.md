# INCLUDE / EXCLUDE Mini app

Simple app created in plain old JavaScript.

To run the application, simply open the HTML file in your browser and go nuts.
Or test it out [here](https://oddis98.github.io/fotmob-coding-challenge/)

## Include

The `include` input field is where you place your ranges that you wish to include in the dataset.
Try typing in some ranges like this: 10-20 30-40 23-34 (seperated by spaces.)

## Exclude

The `exclude` field works in the exact same way as the input field.
Try typing in ranges in the same fashion.

## Run

Click `Do Calculation` and watch the numbers to be included printed out on the screen.
You may also see the execution time of the program.
